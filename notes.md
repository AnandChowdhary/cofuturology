# Cofuturology

## Initial ideas

No expectations for this to be a full-time thing, or even go on after the first few episodes. My idea is “we’ll see where this goes”; if we’re able to just have conversations about where we want to go (futurology?) every other week, it’s more than enough for a great podcast. If we start, it’ll be interesting to see how long we can take it.

After the first few episodes, I think it’ll be a good idea to have conversations with guests. I think Peter-Paul Verbeek is an excellent first guest, if we can convince him to do an hour-long Skype call with us. Then, I can bring in some super smart and interesting people in the technology field and talk about potentially disruptive tech and what it means for our future.

1 hour every alternate weekend is all I’ll need from you, and I can take care of sound editing and technical aspects like publishing, etc., so that we’re able to get started as quickly as possible. Though we’re both super busy for the coming few weeks/months, I think there’s a large potential audience because of the current situation, and launching episode 1 earlier the better is my goal. (Anand)

### Name ideas

I think “Futurology” is a great theme because it’s generic enough that our regular conversations can be classified as so, and it’s interesting enough to be unique. "Futurology with Jeff and Anand” is a potential name. (Anand)

Cofuturology. (Jeff)

Love it. (Anand)

### Recording ideas

- First recording date: Weekend of April 9–10 (Anand)
  - May [???] (Jeff)
    - Yes, May, sorry! (Anand)
- Video or audio only? (Jeff)
  - I’m open to both, I think we can always release the video later as a “bonus”, and it might be easier for us to have a conversation where we can see each other. We don’t share the video at first, but I think it’s good to have it. (Anand)
  - Video - the new ipad pro shoots 4k video. I have a Rode videomicro to be delivered today. Let’s see what we can do! (Jeff)
    - Set up recording on the samsung a7, rode videomicro, shooting 1:1 video.1440x1440. The camera automatically limits videos to 4gb, but also seems to automatically open another video for continuous recording past that point. I think that 4gb is about 30 minutes.
  - Oops… google platform makes this independent recording a non issue.
    - I am also able to record my computer screen and audio separately
    - And, I am able to edit these (phone and computer files) together using Camtasia into one file if that would be useful.

### Content ideas

How controversial do you want me to be? I expect that all things are on the table. Recognize polarity without causing the polarization. My purpose is meeting extreme views honestly so that they can be reconciled with what may end up being the truth about something. For instance, I might suggest that populism and nationalism are understandable reactions to globalization pressures and impacts including the disenfranchisement of certain stakeholders which renders even some extreme nationalist responses rational, from that point of view… etc.? OK? (Jeff)

Absolutely, I think the more controversial the better (the _co_ in cofuturology doesn’t have to be the _co_ in co-founder, but can be **_contradictory_**** like our opinions, or ****_controversial_**** like our guests)**. I think the populism example is pretty powerful and I’d love to talk about that more during recording. (Anand)

Let me know more about your vision for format and so on, even something ideal like a show on RT or whatever, but what would this ideal program format be for you? Interested to find out - looking forward to hearing back. (Jeff)

I think the basic format is “two dudes talking,” which means keeping things informal and discussion-based. In the beginning, it’s just us having a conversation that we record. Later, we can prepare specific discussion questions for guests and have conversations with them as well. (Anand)

Let’s have an agenda. Maybe we can think about different segments. News segment. ‘What are you working on’ segment. ‘Possible futures’ segment where we offer a prediction and perhaps how tech/talent may deliver us to this future? (Jeff)

	Great idea! Especially because I’m working on a ton of different, new things all the time, so this is an interesting place to talk about the “reflection” aspect of those products, and share them with you and the world. We can have a more concrete agenda after the first episode, perhaps? (Anand)

#### Ideas

- Introductions
  - Meeting after second _Reflection_ for CreaTe class
    - Anand is really good at identifying opportunities, plugging these into his existing networks/initiative and creating new ones from this synthesis, as is evident in this vid/podcast. (Jeff)
    - Destined for greatness! (Jeff)
  - I read Jeff’s background extensively and was super impressed! There’s so much I didn’t know, like how a local TV station attended your class because of how excited the students were, and your contribution to Lorenzo Magnani’s book. (Anand)
    - You read magnani’s book, Knowledge as Vuty? Or Violence? Maybe you mean Jun Tani’s book? (Jeff)
      - I mean “Understanding Violence”, where Chapter 1 quotes your perspective ([source](https://archive.org/stream/Lorenzo_Magnani_Understanding_Violence/Lorenzo_Magnani_Understanding_Violence_djvu.txt)): _“My friend and young colleague Jeffrey Benjamin White contends that moral perception typically has to do with how a person feels/thinks/judges that the world as a whole should be. He is right. He also adds that what a person perceives demands a consistent account of all related things.”_ (Anand)
- Remember our first sit - down: Mushroom growth, sustainability, focusing on short-term vs. long-term impact (Anand)
  - Ideology of the fungus runs deeper than short/long term. (Jeff)
  - It is about resource management in the space of opportunity. (Jeff)
    - Mushroom ideology exhausts local resources and then creates spores to cast into space with the presumption that fertile ground is accessible for another iteration of the same ideology. (Jeff)
      - Cue the romance around Space-X and space travel in general (Jeff)
        - It is comforting to feel that resources are endless given techno development and human ingenuity (Jeff)
          - Captains of industry (finance, really) thus encourage policies that assume this techno hurdle is/will be overcome before the local resources are exhausted.
          - Except that we are close and no space travel forthcoming...
          - Side note not for publication - The covid lockdown may well be a recentering of power around the mushroom people as they realize that control of narrative is lost (AGW, Moon landing, WW2 westernization, demonization of Nazis/nationalism/populism, hidden role of finance in engineering wealth transfer and motivating regime change and so on, etc)
            - **IMPORTANT NOTE FROM ANAND:** This Google Docs file is public, so maybe it’s a good idea to share not-for-publication ideas on WhatsApp or an email thread?
- COVID-19 and the current state of things
  - Resource management, essential business and a new economic institutional arrangement
    - Possible futures? From a shutdown state, we may project an ideal global political economy - what does this look like to you?
      - Utopia - what does this mean for you?
      - How to reconcile differences and coordinate over the course of generations to deliver to a sustainable institutional (non-mushroom) arrangement
        - Prospects for top down vs bottom up implementations?
        - The role of religions over historical/evolutionary time
        - For another time: The mouse project, self-development, and solving large scale intergeneration coordination problems with ubiquitous distributed computing in a purely cooperative non coercive non violent way. 
    - Close on faith in institutions and the UN for example, announce intention to get PPVerbeek to talk with us for an hour about tech mediation, possible futures, and what he knows from his association with UNESCO and so on…
- Stop at 1 hour+/- (Jeff)
  - Yep, let’s have a soft limit after 55 mins and a hard limit at 1 hour 15 mins

Notes:

99+% of energy reaching Earth comes from the Sun!

The Sun is growing less active => less energy to Earth => cooling!

Maybe people will want more CO2 soon? ^^/-
