1. _Talking
_
1. “Thanks for listening to Cofuturology, hosted by Dr. Jeffrey White and Anand Chowdhary. You can read our show notes on our website cofuturology.twente.me. Our podcast is also open source on GitHub. Our music is by Wowa, who you can listen to on Spotify. You can also find this podcast on Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast, or anywhere else you listen to podcasts. Thanks for listening to our first episode, we’ll be back with more soon!”

#### Why are we here?

- <Anand> - Introductions
  - I read Jeff’s background extensively and was super impressed! There’s so much I didn’t know, like how a local TV station attended your class because of how excited the students were, and your contribution to Lorenzo Magnani’s book. (Anand)
    - You read magnani’s book, Knowledge as Duty? Or Violence? Maybe you mean Jun Tani’s book? (Jeff)
      - I mean “Understanding Violence”, where Chapter 1 quotes your perspective ([source](https://archive.org/stream/Lorenzo_Magnani_Understanding_Violence/Lorenzo_Magnani_Understanding_Violence_djvu.txt)): _“My friend and young colleague Jeffrey Benjamin White contends that moral perception typically has to do with how a person feels/thinks/judges that the world as a whole should be. He is right. He also adds that what a person perceives demands a consistent account of all related things.”_ (Anand)
    - <Jeff> Meeting after second _Reflection_ for CreaTe class
      - Anand is really good at identifying opportunities, plugging these into his existing networks/initiative and creating new ones from this synthesis, as is evident in this vid/podcast. (Jeff)
        - Destined for greatness! (Jeff)

- <Anand> Remember our first sit - down: Mushroom growth, sustainability, focusing on short-term vs. long-term impact (Anand)
  - Ideology of the fungus runs deep. Let me tell a story about evolutionary paths, in particular about mushrooms and mycelia and the use of resources. (Jeff)
  - It is about resource management in the space of opportunity. (Jeff)
    - Mushroom ideology exhausts local resources and then creates spores to cast into space with the presumption that fertile ground is accessible for another iteration of the same ideology. (Jeff)
      - Cue the romance around Space-X and space travel in general (Jeff)
        - It is comforting to feel that resources are endless given techno development and human ingenuity (Jeff)
          - Captains of industry (finance, really) thus encourage policies that assume this techno hurdle is/will be overcome before the local resources are exhausted.
            - This is common in business schools, to simplify the supply side away as a technical problem for other disciplines, i.e. for the scientists who work for us managers.
              - **So, we end up with people who do not know how the world works trying to make the world work! It is nuts!
**
          - And, we are close and no space travel forthcoming…
            - Look at the Boeing 737 Max - in this business environment, with these sorts of problems happening with airplanes with hundred of people on board, is space travel really on the agenda?
              - Boeing Moon37 Max? EEk.
      - COVID-19 and the current state of things.
        - One interesting result of the Covid lockdown has been environmental - 
          - People get used to doing less, come to value simple things more, (hopefully).
          - Learn how to drink at home => less drunk driving!
          - Get used to at distance meetings, rather than flying!
          - Get used to at distance work, rather than commuting, payign to heat office spaces, wrappers from take out lunches, the ripple effects here on consumption are obvious.
        - Let’s look at the use of plastic and other resources but specifically plastic to maintain the hyper-busy dog-eat-dog world of neo-liberal surveillance capitalism!
          - This is something to worry about, far more important than CO2 emissions!
    - <Anand> - You cannot be saying that you don’t believe in man made global warming etc!
    - For instance these facts [!!!]
      - X, Y, Z…
    - <Jeff> - Let’s put this aside for now and focus on the plastic waste and these issues that are more tangible and still related to the global slow/lockdown.
      - I will note though that 99.99% of all energy affecting the Earth comes from the Sun, and that we should expect a continued cooling due to diminished solar activity as the Sun goes through cycles which have been extensively studied, especially you may find the work of this group in Germany interesting [??? Jeff will get links ???]
  - <Anand> - Let’s move ahead in the discussion now to talk about resource management, essential business and a new economic institutional arrangement that will come out of this lockdown.
    - Possible futures? From a shutdown state, we may project an ideal global political economy - what does this look like to you?
      - For me, this is what I expect … [Anand will give first projections ???]
      - <jeff> - I am an ethicist and an idealist so I end up asking what SHOULD we aim for in coming out of this unprecedented period of reflection.
      - Another way of asking - Utopia - what does this mean for you?
      - Practically, then, once we see what this is for most everyone, we must figure out how to reconcile differences and coordinate over the course of generations to deliver to a consensus sustainable institutional (non-mushroom) arrangement
        - Prospects for top down vs bottom up implementations?
        - The role of religions over historical/evolutionary time
        - For another time: The mouse project, self-development, and solving large scale intergeneration coordination problems with ubiquitous distributed computing in a purely cooperative non coercive non violent way. 
    - Close on faith in institutions and the UN for example, announce intention to get PPVerbeek to talk with us for an hour about tech mediation, possible futures, and what he knows from his association with UNESCO and so on…
  - CLOSE - <Anand> - You have been listening to Cofuturology with Anand Chowdhary and Jeffrey White, a podcast [about ???] distributed every two weeks with a focus on ideal futures and how to get there. If you would like to contribute to this podcast, perhaps join us for an interview drawing attention to your own work or if you would like to send us a letter, perhaps for us to read on air, please send an email to cofuturology at gmail dot com [???]. [Anand has a signature closing phrase???]
- Stop at 1 hour+/- (Jeff)
  - Yep, let’s have a soft limit after 55 mins and a hard limit at 1 hour 15 mins

Notes:

99+% of energy reaching Earth comes from the Sun!

The Sun is growing less active => less energy to Earth => cooling!

Maybe people will want more CO2 soon? ^^/-

### Episode 2

I actually really like the transcript that we had above for the first show. Maybe we can play through that? 

Maybe we can also talk a bit about some of the below:

I propose that we use ‘Departments’ to segment the show. This can keep discussion focused, the show fast moving, and we can cover a lot of ground without getting lost.

Departments? Ideas:

**Anand and on and on and on...** - Update on all of your ongoing-ness.

**Eggheadlines** - some one or two things from geek media, science, conspiracy theory, philosophy, books, etc. Can be a “What are you studying lately?” sort of segment. Ideally, we look at interesting things and then speculate on what they mean for the future, maybe asking “So, what are the broader implications here?” The perspective is cutting edge looking back from the futures that result from people pursuing and succeeding in these inquiries. So, surveillance built into phone hardware that upload biometric data directly as its inbuilt sensors take temperature and other information maybe from nets in caps measuring also brain activity, perhaps with the reverse potential to influence these neural processes through EMF. Musk’s neuro stuff might result int something like this.

**Pop culture corner** - For instance, the idea that DIsney is talking about what it is doing to itself, and to the Star Wars legacy, when its main antagonist says that history must be killed if necessary to make something new. This is straight out of Plato’s Republic and the discussion of the ideal City, how to make it happen, and the sorts of stories that should educated the youth. Other headlines might be Zoom getting banned, Tesla going back to work, Joe Rogan saying that Tesla’s make other cars seem stupid, even the tragic transformation of Warhammer… Parasite and Snowpiercer might get their own show, but we can introduce this idea during one segment of Deep culture one day maybe.

**Wishing, well** - Where we look at tech developments aimed at human flourishing, and rate how well or not (instead of hot or not, a rating of how effective this development may turn out to be for human flourishing and health). Med-tech stuff would go here, Covid response stuff, etc…

**Tikki Tikki Tembo, never gonna happen though! **- This is where we look at tech dev or big ideas that sound great but will never be built or effectively implemented, or are too costly and shortsighted, or that have consequences that outweigh any conceivable benefit, e.g. putting stuff in the atmosphere to offset non-existent warming. I would put Mars exploration and people living on Mars here, also. Yeah, right, but we have bigger local problems, for instance how to protect the Earth from asteroids.

**It’s Rikki Tikki Tavi, beyatch! **- Where we point to snakes and gut them because they are snakes, to protect the garden. So, Gates and polio resurgence, sterilizing women in Africa etc. Also the cost of exercise equipment in the Netherlands, damn. 70Euros for a 20kg dumbbell? WTF? Zuckerberg and addictive kid’s games, Monsanto and big agri-chem and politicians and dead bees and butterflies, the literal sterilization of nature, kicking flowers in the figurative balls, you get the idea.

**Thank you sir, may I have another?** - Where we talk about stuff that we did that we like, purchased and would purchase again, recommend, etc. 

**In the noobs** - This is where we talk about tragic consequences of doing things for the first time, e.g. Space X crashes or maybe even Windows updates bricking machines (as if noobs).

**Pre dick shins** - this is where we tell the future that we are going to kick it square in the nutz!

Do you have any ideas about departments, Anand? What do you think of the idea?

## Initial ideas

No expectations for this to be a full-time thing, or even go on after the first few episodes. My idea is “we’ll see where this goes”; if we’re able to just have conversations about where we want to go (futurology?) every other week, it’s more than enough for a great podcast. If we start, it’ll be interesting to see how long we can take it.

After the first few episodes, I think it’ll be a good idea to have conversations with guests. I think Peter-Paul Verbeek is an excellent first guest, if we can convince him to do an hour-long Skype call with us. Then, I can bring in some super smart and interesting people in the technology field and talk about potentially disruptive tech and what it means for our future.

1 hour every alternate weekend is all I’ll need from you, and I can take care of sound editing and technical aspects like publishing, etc., so that we’re able to get started as quickly as possible. Though we’re both super busy for the coming few weeks/months, I think there’s a large potential audience because of the current situation, and launching episode 1 earlier the better is my goal. (Anand)

### Name ideas

I think “Futurology” is a great theme because it’s generic enough that our regular conversations can be classified as so, and it’s interesting enough to be unique. "Futurology with Jeff and Anand” is a potential name. (Anand)

Cofuturology. (Jeff)

Love it. (Anand)

### Recording ideas

- First recording date: Weekend of April 9–10 (Anand)
  - May [???] (Jeff)
    - Yes, May, sorry! (Anand)
- Second recording date: Weekend May 23-24 [???]

- Video or audio only? (Jeff)
  - I’m open to both, I think we can always release the video later as a “bonus”, and it might be easier for us to have a conversation where we can see each other. We don’t share the video at first, but I think it’s good to have it. (Anand)
  - Video - the new ipad pro shoots 4k video. I have a Rode videomicro to be delivered today. Let’s see what we can do! (Jeff)
    - Set up recording on the samsung a7, rode videomicro, shooting 1:1 video.1440x1440. The camera automatically limits videos to 4gb, but also seems to automatically open another video for continuous recording past that point. I think that 4gb is about 30 minutes.
  - Oops… google platform makes this independent recording a non issue.
    - I am also able to record my computer screen and audio separately
    - And, I am able to edit these (phone and computer files) together using Camtasia into one file if that would be useful.

### Content ideas

How controversial do you want me to be? I expect that all things are on the table. Recognize polarity without causing the polarization. My purpose is meeting extreme views honestly so that they can be reconciled with what may end up being the truth about something. For instance, I might suggest that populism and nationalism are understandable reactions to globalization pressures and impacts including the disenfranchisement of certain stakeholders which renders even some extreme nationalist responses rational, from that point of view… etc.? OK? (Jeff)

Absolutely, I think the more controversial the better (the _co_ in cofuturology doesn’t have to be the _co_ in co-founder, but can be **_contradictory_**** like our opinions, or ****_controversial_**** like our guests)**. I think the populism example is pretty powerful and I’d love to talk about that more during recording. (Anand)

Let me know more about your vision for format and so on, even something ideal like a show on RT or whatever, but what would this ideal program format be for you? Interested to find out - looking forward to hearing back. (Jeff)

I think the basic format is “two dudes talking,” which means keeping things informal and discussion-based. In the beginning, it’s just us having a conversation that we record. Later, we can prepare specific discussion questions for guests and have conversations with them as well. (Anand)

Let’s have an agenda. Maybe we can think about different segments. News segment. ‘What are you working on’ segment. ‘Possible futures’ segment where we offer a prediction and perhaps how tech/talent may deliver us to this future? (Jeff)

	Great idea! Especially because I’m working on a ton of different, new things all the time, so this is an interesting place to talk about the “reflection” aspect of those products, and share them with you and the world. We can have a more concrete agenda after the first episode, perhaps? (Anand)

**The following may be text in an accompanying blog someday who knows.
**

People are worms (with fancy outside parts). They live in a hole in the ground! They really, do, as I mention in the final lines of this stream of consciousness. They put the good in the front and the bad comes out the back. The trouble is that, if we look around, we have put so much good in front of ourselves that we are drowning in our own waste. No living system can thrive in its own waste! This is why we have filters in aquariums and plants on the planet Earth. Consumption, and the institutional arrangements composed to deliver to these wants rather than needs (to flourish), has been weaponized, resulting in the empowerment of exactly the worst sort of governance. For one, there is the debt-based financial economy, where leaders lead by attracting people to vice (e.g. gluttony, excess in every way invites indebtedness and dependency through law, which gives power as if the wealthiest were s/he with the most slaves, without regard to the human potential and quality of life of those slaves - Aristotle hates this aspect). For another, there is Aristotle’s direct criticism of democracy that it is led by the desires of the average and effectively most base, and this is what we see in the West. Since I have been paying attention, there has been this culture of victimhood, and maybe from this a revenge sort of culture, just violence, supporting the myth of the just war. This absurdity extends now into this Covid farce. The USA - government officials of which have been paying for exactly this sort of research in cooperation with China and other countries - is lately complaining that they have been victimized by China. Now we see headlines of inflamed tensions and sure, it is difficult not to see that we have always been at war with ABC re 1984. But, the point is that it gels with the populace, or at least it seems to; so we can see how the expectations of a compliant populace might be crafted in a way that responds by demanding certain actions. At least, when I look at the comments on Zerohedge for instance, some will call for war with China, and the USA military is constantly flying warplanes near to China, sending warships through the region, no doubt killing whales with their super sonar as if this is even necessary. It is theater. But people expect it, they are raised within a culture that even demands it, and people profit from it. Lately, this had been wearing a bit thin. The people of the USA were tiring of endless war enrichment of the worst people in the world. Suspicion had been growing over the actual intentions of leadership, and this was gelling around the world from Paris to Palestine, 9/11 to now the way that the West ignores the role of Russian in WW2. Everything is a lie. Remember that Trump came in on the hopes that he - a builder and business man - would return troops and money from foreign wars to rebuild bridges and schools and to run hospitals and shooting ranges in the USA. The Russian collusion war internal to the USA was fought, recall the past 2.5 years in effect neutering whatever influence Trump may have had in doing so if indeed his intentions were genuinely stated, and realist from the beginning. Many people thought that Trump was a bit naive, but the benefit here is that at least some of these ideas had been put into the public discourse… From here, people should be able to sort things out but this is another thing, speaking to censorship and it is important here, in the sense that available information informs expectations. People were getting a lot of information. Seth Rich, Clinton’s private servers in a bathroom in a house somewhere … such a strange story. This all only in the context of Russiagate but this sort of thing was happening everywhere. Something had to happen. People were - as they say - “waking up”. And wallah - with this new family of viruses, there is a new war that few have education to understand and tired people got to stay home for a couple months while others consolidated their positions and now, well, one may be suspicious. The Twin Towers had been closed floor by floor for a while before they eventually fell at the speed of gravity. Now, we have surveillance apps, so called “essential” economic services. Amazon hosting USA government information, drones and delivery services, social distancing. This all seems reasonable in the context of made-available information, but all of this implies the disempowerment of the individual and the local community in what the US Constitution names the right of free assembly, and freedom of speech where speech is truthful representation of practice. The spirit of this wording is that a person should not suffer for saying what is true. This is also reflected in the famous 5th amendment, where to say what is true in a court would be to implicate one’s self in a crime. One cannot be compelled to do this, under the law. Instead, in the USA under Obama, it became legal for officers of the US government to directly lie to the people of the USA - to propagandize them - in order to mislead them. Indeed, to purposefully mislead them. This was all beginning to fall apart. With social media, free discourse, smart people working to bring people together - we never hear about this sort of thing but this was out there, this feeling. Yellow vests were not disappearing. They were becoming a way of life and would likely spread at least to the USA where people work more hours per week than others, to suffer the worst healthcare in the Western world, the worst educational outcomes… Now, the worms had turned around in the space of all things good and had begun to put the good that was truth in front of them and this was a problem so now, the spontaneous organization of the worms towards the common good has been interrupted, worms separated and corralled, and an external good provided in the form of directives and so on. Certainly there are some upshots in the slowdown of the global economy and the recognition of the ‘green’-ness of hi info-tech and entertainment and so on as people realize that they can live better with less stress and more efficient use of energy and resources from a distance. I have written about this a bit and also there is the upshot that we can think about what an idea arrangement might be. The problem is that the same interest group which created these problems by mishandling the political economy for their own benefit (re Aristotle, earlier) are the one’s in charge and gaining power in, through, and over this transition into what will eventually be - from the looks of things at the outset, e.g. without any new yellow vests who can spontaneously organize around common interest while respecting 2meter distancing guidelines, and be able to keep this up as a way of life with what will eventually become compulsory work assignments to so-called essential industries, i.e. be sent to the gulag (effectively for insubordination). The Western world is already set up for such an eventuality, if you look around. The worms march on but they do so in the space of a dark cave as Plato had described, purposefully directed according to the shadows projected by the people in charge of the cave.
