# Cofuturology

## Initial ideas

No expectations for this to be a full-time thing, or even go on after the first few episodes. My idea is “we’ll see where this goes”; if we’re able to just have conversations about where we want to go (futurology?) every other week, it’s more than enough for a great podcast. If we start, it’ll be interesting to see how long we can take it.

After the first few episodes, I think it’ll be a good idea to have conversations with guests. I think Peter-Paul Verbeek is an excellent first guest, if we can convince him to do an hour-long Skype call with us. Then, I can bring in some super smart and interesting people in the technology field and talk about potentially disruptive tech and what it means for our future.

1 hour every alternate weekend is all I’ll need from you, and I can take care of sound editing and technical aspects like publishing, etc., so that we’re able to get started as quickly as possible. Though we’re both super busy for the coming few weeks/months, I think there’s a large potential audience because of the current situation, and launching episode 1 earlier the better is my goal. (Anand)

### Name ideas

I think “Futurology” is a great theme because it’s generic enough that our regular conversations can be classified as so, and it’s interesting enough to be unique. "Futurology with Jeff and Anand” is a potential name. (Anand)

Cofuturology. (Jeff)

Love it. (Anand)

### Recording ideas

- First recording date: Weekend of April 9–10
- Video or audio only? I’m open to both, I think we can always release the video later as a “bonus”, and it might be easier for us to have a conversation where we can see each other. We don’t share the video at first, but I think it’s good to have it.

### Content ideas

How controversial do you want me to be? I expect that all things are on the table. Recognize polarity without causing the polarization. My purpose is meeting extreme views honestly so that they can be reconciled with what may end up being the truth about something. For instance, I might suggest that populism and nationalism are understandable reactions to globalization pressures and impacts including the disenfranchisement of certain stakeholders which renders even some extreme nationalist responses rational, from that point of view… etc.? OK? (Jeff)

Absolutely, I think the more controversial the better (the _co_ in cofuturology doesn’t have to be the _co_ in co-founder, but can be _contradictory_ like our opinions, or _controversial_ like our guests). I think the populism example is pretty powerful and I’d love to talk about that more during recording. (Anand)

Let me know more about your vision for format and so on, even something ideal like a show on RT or whatever, but what would this ideal program format be for you? Interested to find out - looking forward to hearing back. (Jeff)

I think the basic format is “two dudes talking,” which means keeping things informal and discussion-based. In the beginning, it’s just us having a conversation that we record. Later, we can prepare specific discussion questions for guests and have conversations with them as well. (Anand)

## Show prep

### Episode 1

- Introductions
  - Meeting after second _Reflection_ for CreaTe class
  - I read Jeff’s background extensively and was super impressed! There’s so much I didn’t know, like how a local TV station attended your class because of how excited the students were, and your contribution to Lorenzo Magnani’s book.
- Mushroom growth, sustainability, focusing on short-term vs. long-term impact
- COVID-19 and the current state of things
