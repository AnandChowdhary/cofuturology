**Cofuturology** is a _concept_ podcast about the future, hosted by [Dr. Jeffrey White](https://utwente.academia.edu/jeffwhite) and [Anand Chowdhary](https://anandchowdhary.com). The idea is to have a conversation over Skype every other week and release at least a few episodes, and then perhaps interview some of our favorite futurists.
